machine learning is proccese or algos that take data [matier premier] and manipulate it and learn from it, ML models can predict numerical values based on historical data.

TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING

supervised learning
where in model wehave label and features that machine algo in supervised learning it take output and input and learn from it
/examples of supervised learning algos
linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree, Random Forests, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, gradient boostion ...

unsupervised learning 
in this hand the algos in unsupervised learning learn only from input without label The model is left to find patterns and relationships in the data on its own
/exmples of unsipervised learning algos
natural language processing, image and video analysis, anomaly detection, customer segmentation, and recommendation engines.


this is just a quick intro we gonna go allthough all this concept
